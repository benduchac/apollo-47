## What is this?

Apollo 47 is a real-time text chat game where 2-6 players improvise stories about routine lunar missions in an alternate 1986. One player deals with a technical problem (jammed hatch, stuck drill bit, malfunctioning antenna) while others provide support over radio chat.

It's collaborative storytelling with technical jargon, radio banter, and human-scale problems in space.
